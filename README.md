## Getting Started with Create React App

* [Getting Started](./CREATE_REACT_APP.md)

Note: Use the stable version of node.js since you might fail to start the
react app with `yarn start` command.

## Bootstrap

To install `jquery`, `bootstrap`, and `popper.js`, run the following command:

```
$ yarn add jquery
$ yarn add bootstrap
$ yarn add @popperjs/core
```
